# python-work
This repository intends to act as a collection of my projects using Python as well as display my works. As part of the collection, this repository is organized into different folders depending on the nature of the project.

## Doing Data Science
This section follows the book "Doing Data Science: Straight Talk From the Frontline" in using their dataset and my own interpretation of the data and results.

## Kaggle
Collection of Jupyter Notebooks and other work that makes use of Datasets provided by Kaggle (Includes Competitions).

## Learning
A collection of Jupyter Notebooks that act as a "Cheat Sheet" by reminding myself of what can be done using some of the libraries I've learnt so far.

## Random Code Snippets
Smaller projects and concepts that I have used Python to solve or explore.
